# ExeQt
A nifty little utility for pinning commands, applications or links to the system tray (It's made with Qt, in case the name wasn't obvious enough)

**Disclaimer:**
I do not own any of the icons used in this project. I thank the wonderful people at findicons.com and iconarchive.com for making these available to the public for free.
